# adventOfCode2016
Working through adventofcode.com.

My focus this year is to gain experience with JavaScript, practice using node and github, be exposed to new functions/algorithms/libraries I haven't played with before, and actually working through how to solve each day. As a relatively new programmer I will be relying heavily on the r/adventofcode community for help! It's more important to me to understand how to solve something and get exposed to new things than to struggle through alone. All users that inspire or inform me will be mentioned at the top of each day's code.
