* Note: Due to other commitments, I wasn't able to finish this year. I intend to still go through the problems at some point, but for now, I don't have much to show for this year. *

Back again! Still using JavaScript, mostly because I like it and I'm still focusing my skills on this language. Same goal as previous years - I want to see if I can improve the number of days I can solve on my own! 

Days I managed to solve on my own: 1 / 

Days I got at least part way but had some assistance from others: 

Days I couldn't solve and had to use someone else's solution:

My focus this year is to use JavaScript again and see if I'm able to solve more days on my own! I want to see if I've improved at all since last year. Understandably, the problems will be different, so it won't be an exact answer to this question. I still want to see if I can do more on my own, or more with less help. :) Excited to see how it goes! Just like last year, I know the community will be a huge help to me, and anyone who helps me on a specific solution will be mentioned at the top of each day's solution.

For my future reference:

Days I managed to solve on my own: 1 / 2 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 8 / 9 / 12 / 13 / 15 / 20 / 22 / 25 - 52%


Days I got at least part way but had some assistance from others: 3 / 7 / 10 / 11 / 14 / 16 / 17 / 18 / 23 / 24 - 40%


Days I couldn't solve and had to use someone else's solution: 19 / 21 - 8%

Made it through another year! I had a ton of fun this year too. And I improved, got through more days on my own! I was also more stubborn this year, and spent longer on some puzzles than I remember doing last year, determined that I could solve them given enough time. Still ended up using help from the community a lot, which I'm incredibly thankful for. And only 2 days this year that I just could not work out what to do myself! That's some great improvement, right there. :) Until next year!

My focus this year is to gain experience with JavaScript, practice using node and github, be exposed to new functions/algorithms/libraries I haven't played with before, and actually working through how to solve each day. As a relatively new programmer I will be relying heavily on the r/adventofcode community for help! It's more important to me to understand how to solve something and get exposed to new things than to struggle through alone. All users that inspire or inform me will be mentioned at the top of each day's code. 

For my future reference:

Days I managed to solve on my own:
1 / 2 / 3 / 6 / 12 / 14 / 15 / 16 / 18 / 23 - 40%

Days I got at least part way but had some assistance from others:
4 / 5 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 19 / 21 - 28%

Days I couldn't solve and had to use someone else's solution:
10 / 11 / 13 / 17 / 20 / 22 / 24 / 25 - 32%

So, end of the month, and I've stuck through it! It's been a lot of fun, and I've got a good list of concepts for JavaScript and programming in general to investigate and learn more about to keep improving and growing my knowledge. I'm actually really surprised that I solved a good bit on my own. Special thanks to all who posted on the subreddit and offered help and their solutions in the megathreads - without the community around this challenge, I wouldn't have had a chance at understanding and working through this.
